Instructions for executing analysis scripts:
  1) Obtain neccessary data: 
    games.csv
    players.csv
    plays.csv
    tackles.csv
    tracking_week_1.csv
    tracking_week_2.csv
    tracking_week_3.csv
    tracking_week_4.csv
    tracking_week_5.csv
    tracking_week_6.csv
    tracking_week_7.csv
    tracking_week_8.csv
    tracking_week_9.csv
  2) Run submissionCode.ipynb to obtain:
      finalResults.csv for results_w_player_info.ipynb
      primaryAndSecondary.csv for finalResults and annimation
  4) Run results_w_player_info.ipynb to see final results with attached player info
  5) Run animationDataExtraction.ipynb to prep for the animation
  6) Run animation.ipynb to generate both animations (ran out of time to cleanup code, sorry)
  7) Run errorTuning.ipynb to see the impact of the distance coefficient (dc)
