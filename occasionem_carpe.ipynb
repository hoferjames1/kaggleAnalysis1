Thus, it goes without saying that we should determine a method to evaluate the number of opportunities presented. Which is what we did for the \"calculated_as_prime\" above. However, what we have not considered yet is the quality of those opportunities. This is what we will call the Opportunity Score and it is simple measure of the average estimated time to reach the ball carrier given distance to ball carrier and closing speed. The method provides and inverse scale of opportunities. For example, if the defensive player calculated to have the highest Success Ratio and Contribution Score has a low Opportunity Score, then they were well positioned to make the majority of their tackles. In contrast, if their Opportunity Score was high, then they would have had to work more to reach the ball carrier.
